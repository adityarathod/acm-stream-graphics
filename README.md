# ACM Stream Graphics

This powered the graphics at [ACM UTD](//acmutd.co)'s Spring 2022 kickoff [live stream](//www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iIJlpq97OI). This is very much unclean spaghetti code, so please don't use this as an example for anything.

## What is a scene group?
A **scene group** is a set of scenes played in sequence on repeat. Scene groups can be used to display different sets of graphics at different points in the stream.
